<h2 id="bonus-work">Bonus Work</h2>
<p><strong>Bonus Points — You may earn between 0 and 100 Bonus Points.</strong>
<strong>Everyone may earn between 0 and 100 Bonus Points.</strong> Every bonus point earned helps your overall grade, but even if you do no bonus work, you can still get 100% for the course. In other words, bonus points can only help you.  Bonus points are extra credit. Here’s how you can get them:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pre-Lecture bonus points (34.5 bonus points)</strong><br />
  Each class there will be a short pre-lecture video posted on Lon Capa followed by a few questions. The pre-lectures are designed to give you a preview of the basic concepts you’ll see in the actual lectures. There are 23 prelectures and each is worth 1.5 bonus points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lon Capa Surveys (25 bonus points)</strong><br />
  There will be 5 surveys due on the first Friday of each month (see the course calendar). Each survey is worth 5 bonus points. The surveys are all anonymous. Lon Capa just records whether or not you submitted a survey, not who submitted which answer. You must answer every question on the survey to get the 5 points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iClicker Points (in person class only, 23 bonus points)</strong><br />
  There are 46 classes this semester and each class is worth 0.5 bonus points.  You get the 0.5 point per class period if you answer all of the iClicker questions for that day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Notebook Submission (25 points for the in person class, 48 points for the online classes)</strong><br />
  We will look over your notebook at the final.  You’ll get full credit if you have all of the pages from lecture filled in.  You may skip all of the practice exams and summary pages.  If you’re missing more than 3 required pages, don’t bother to turn in the notebook because you will receive negative bonus points.  You will pick up the notebook at the end of the semester to keep forever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Freebie (1 bonus point)</strong><br />
  Everyone will get 1 bonus point automatically for free just because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpV-gGA4PSk">😉</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Research Opportunities</strong><br />
  There are usually a few research opportunities to participate in throughout the semester. The details will be posted on our course Canvas page as they come up! These opportunities are completely optional but give those who want to a chance to participate in a real study going on at the University.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How do these bonus points get calculated into your grade?</strong>  At the end of the semester, take your total bonus points (capped at 100) and divide them by 20. This will be how many percentage points get added to your grade! For example, if you have all 100 bonus points, you’d take 100 and divide it by 20 to get 5. So, if you have an 80% (B-) in the class, the bonus will bring you up to an 85% (B).  You may have more than 100 bonus points, but the max that will count will be 100.</p>

<h2 id="course-outline">Course Outline</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Study Design</strong>: observational studies vs. randomized experiments, why randomized controls are key, confounders in observational studies, Simpson’s Paradox, intent to treat analysis, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong>: mean, median, SD, histograms, box plots, normal curve, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Linear Regression</strong>: correlation coefficient, simple linear regression, the RMSE, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Probability</strong>: chance, multiplication rule, addition rule, conditional probability, Bayes rule, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Statistics for Random Variables</strong>: expected value and standard error of chance processes, probability histograms and the Central Limit Theorem, developing simple chance models box models that more complicated sampling processes can be translated into, the Law of Averages, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Sampling and Statistical Inference</strong>: using sample means and percents to estimate population means and proportions, attaching margins of errors to our estimates by computing confidence intervals, why randomized sampling is key, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Significance Tests</strong>: one sample and two sample z-tests, t-tests, and chi-square tests for goodness of fit and independence, the focus is on understanding how these tests depend on chance models.</li>
  <li><strong>Limits of Significance Tests</strong>: understanding what the p-value means and under what circumstances it is valid (for example, hypotheses must be stated before looking at the data, the total number of experiments before significant results were found must be reported, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you cheat on an exam or attempt to cheat on an exam in this class you’re very likely to get caught and the consequences will be <b>SEVERE</b>. See the <b><a href="https://studentcode.illinois.edu/" target="\_blank">University Student Code of Conduct</a></b>.</li>
  <li>You are not allowed to work with other people on exams and you are not allowed to use cheating websites like Chegg. All exams will be in person.  We have multiple versions of all exams that may look identical at first glance but are not. Bottom line is, please don’t cheat. It’s not worth risking your entire college career and you will get caught. If you are caught, you will get a 0 on the exam and be reported to the university.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dres-accommodations">DRES Accommodations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I am happy to offer accommodations for disabilities verified through DRES (<b><a href="http://www.disability.illinois.edu/" target="\_blank">http://www.disability.illinois.edu/</a></b>). Please email me a copy of your letter during Week 1. I will provide the extra time accommodation for any student who needs it and sends me their DRES letter.  If you have any other questions or need any other accommodations, don’t hesitate to reach out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpV-gGA4PSk">😊</a></li>
