                  <p style="padding-top: 2em;">Hi everyone! My name is Karle and I'm one of the stat 100 instructors. I've always loved math, statistics, and education. Teaching stat 100 is the perfect job for me since I can help students from many different majors gain an appreciation for all 3.<br /><br /> A few other things about me: I'm a huge Illini fan- I went to school at UIUC, met my husband at UIUC, and now I work here. U of I is one of my favorite places in the world! I also enjoy spending time outside, playing piano, water skiing, snow skiing, and traveling.</p>

I really enjoyed this class and had a lot of fun taking it! It was a very beneficial and relevant experience to help me with my other courses. More about me: I am from Chicago, I am learning to crochet, and I sometimes go for runs!</p>

I love how important statistics are in the real world, and how they can be applied to every major. Apart from being a CA, Iâm also involved in the a-cappella group Girls Next Door, NSSLHA, and the honors fraternity Phi Eta Sigma. I love music and performing, one of my favorite artists is Taylor Swift! Iâm looking forward to meeting you during office hours!!</p>

I took STAT 100 last semester and it was one of the funnest, most rewarding classes I've taken. This class has equipped me with the proper skills for interpreting data, which in turn has helped me make informed decisions, prioritize, and analyze daily problems in life. Needless to say, I'm so excited to work with y'all and make STAT 100 a fun, beneficial class for everyone! Some fun facts about me: I love to cook, paint, listen to music, and read. Hope to meet y'all at office hours this semester!</p>

My name is Allanah Martin, and I am a Sophomore studying Food Science and Human Nutrition with a concentration in Human Nutrition and a minor in Chemistry. I really enjoyed taking STATS 100 because everything I've learned from this class has helped me in my other classes. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, eating Olive Garden, and watching the Simpsons. I am very excited to be a CA this semester and I am even more excited to meet everyone at office hours!</p>
