    Hi everyone! My name is Karle and I'm one of the stat 100 instructors. I've always loved math, statistics, and education. Teaching stat 100 is the perfect job for me since I can help students from many different majors gain an appreciation for all 3.<br><br> A few other things about me: I'm a huge Illini fan- I went to school at UIUC, met my husband at UIUC, and now I work here. U of I is one of my favorite places in the world! I also enjoy spending time outside, playing piano, water skiing, snow skiing, and traveling.

I'm very excited to be a part of the Stat 100 team this year and help others gain a better understanding of this great subject!

    Hi! My name is Meg and I'm a freshman studying Speech and Hearing Sciences with a minor in Disability Studies. I took Stat100 last semester and really enjoyed the course, which inspired me to apply to become a Course Assistant. I love how important statistics are in the real world, and how they can be applied to every major. Apart from being a CA, I'm also involved in the a-cappella group Girls Next Door and the club NSSLHA. I love music and performing, one of my favorite artists is Taylor Swift! I'm looking forward to meeting you during office hours!!
