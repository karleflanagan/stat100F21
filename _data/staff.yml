    Hi everyone! My name is Karle and I'm the instructor this course. I've always loved math, statistics, and education. Teaching Stat 100 is the perfect job for me since I can help students from many different majors gain an appreciation for all 3.<br><br> A few other things about me: I'm a huge Illini fan- I went to school at UIUC, met my husband at UIUC, and now I work here. U of I is one of my favorite places in the world! I also enjoy spending time outside, playing piano, water skiing, snow skiing, and traveling.
