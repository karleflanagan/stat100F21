    Hi everyone! My name is Karle and I'm one of the stat 100 instructors. I've always loved math, statistics, and education. Teaching stat 100 is the perfect job for me since I can help students from many different majors gain an appreciation for all 3.<br><br> A few other things about me: I'm a huge Illini fan- I went to school at UIUC, met my husband at UIUC, and now I work here. U of I is one of my favorite places in the world! I also enjoy spending time outside, playing piano, water skiing, snow skiing, and traveling.

    Hi! My name is Kate Roeser, and I am so excited to be a CA in my last semester here at Illinois! I took STAT100 my freshman year when I was undecided, and it led me to continue that path and declare a statistics major. I am so excited to be a CA and help students love the class like I did. I am currently looking for a job after I graduate, but outside of that I love to spend my time working out, hanging out with my friends, and going back to the suburbs to visit my family.

    Hi there! My name is Maha Hussain and I am a senior studying Statistics and minoring in Business and Spanish.

Outside of school, I love watching sitcoms (New Girl and the Office are definitely my favorites), getting bubble tea, and playing with my cat who I recently adopted.
