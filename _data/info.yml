# Homework
hw-duedates: "every Tuesday and Thursday at 11:59pm"

# Exam Information
# base-name is important for retrieving exam pdfs.
# exam 1 location is added in exams.md through exam_schedule.html, leave empty here but update in exam_schedule.html (located in "_includes" folder). Also for quick editing of exam_schedule.html table, use exam_schedule.tgn in the "tools" folder. Upload this .tgn file to https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to edit easily. This same process can be used to edit the final schedule in final-schedule.html using final-schedule.tgn (these files are found in same places as exam_schedule files).
# show-exams is a T/F variable that controls the viewability of the practice exam pdfs. i.e. if show-exams for exam 3 is not T, then all of the exam 3 practise exams (with exception of 2016 key) will be greyed out and won't link to the pdfs. show-finals is the same kind of variable but for practise finals pdfs.
# T: Shows all exams in group.
# F: Shows only the practice exam material of group.
# FF: Hides all exams of group.

- title: "Why everyone needs to know Basic Statistics"
  body: "Statistics is a tool to make sense of large amounts of information. Common sense can only handle limited amounts of information. Until recently common sense was sufficient for most people because daily life didn't involve processing a large amount of data. Now large stores of information have become readily available. You can either choose to ignore the information available or you can choose to make sense of it, which means learning statistics."

- title: "What's special about Stat 100"
  body: "Most people think statistics is boring and difficult. Statistics is to data, what grammar is to words. And like grammar, it's only interesting if it's used to understand something interesting.<br><br>
  In Stat 100, we use statistics to research a topic we're all interested in - ourselves. We collect data on ourselves through anonymous surveys, largely on the sort of social questions on which students have shown intense interest. Having real questions that we want to answer motivates real understanding, not just memorizing some complicated rules. Statistics is a collection of real tools- the key is to understand which one to use when and why."

# Student experiences
experiences:
- text: "Read the newspaper in a new way, without their eyes glazing over when they see quantitative information."
- text: "Know what questions to ask in evaluating studies and surveys."
- text: "Understand what questions can and cannot be answered by statistical arguments."
- text: "Appreciate how much of what matters to them can be better understood with statistics."
- text: "Feel much more confident applying both logical reasoning and common sense to quantitative topics but are very aware that their intuition can sometimes be so wrong that it's shocking."
- text: "But what's most surprising is they actually like statistics!"
