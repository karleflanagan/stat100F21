        <p>Hi Everyone,</p>

<p>I hope you‚Äôre doing well!  We wanted to share with you how we are planning to transition Stat 100 to be fully online after spring break. Here is a breakdown of what will happen to each course component:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lectures:</strong> We will not be holding synchronous lectures at our normal class time. Instead, we will post lecture videos to <a href="https://compass2g.illinois.edu/" target="\_blank">Compass</a> for you to watch at a time that‚Äôs convenient for you (if you are in the online section, this is what you normally have been doing!). Fortunately, we do have lectures from previous semesters that we can always use. The Stat 100 instructors (Karle and Kelly) are also hoping to re-film at least a few videos this semester in order to help keep things fresh and authentic for you if we can! The lecture videos will be posted to our Compass page at 9am Central Time each week on Monday.  This is before the regularly scheduled lectures would have taken place so that you can stay on pace and choose to watch the videos at the same time as your normal class if you‚Äôd like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iClickers:</strong> If you are enrolled in the in-person sections (L1 &amp; L2), then we will simply take the iClicker points you have now as counting for the entire semester. This will most likely be to your advantage since we will still drop 2 days even though we had only half as many iClicker days as a normal semester.  Your final iClicker percentage is now posted in Compass.  Remember, iClickers are solely extra credit so these points can only help you, not hurt you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Completed Notebook:</strong> We‚Äôve determined that it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to check everyone‚Äôs notebook so we‚Äôve decided to give everyone those bonus points this semester.  That will be 40 bonus points for the online section and to make it fair for the in-person class, we are going to make the notebook 40 bonus points as well.  The iClickers will now only be 20 bonus points.  This change is noted here on the <a href="https://karleflanagan.github.io/stat100S20/pages/syllabus.html" target="\_blank">syllabus</a>.  We hope these free bonus points will make things a little less stressful for you during this time :) With that being said, we can‚Äôt recommend enough to continue filling in the notebook! It‚Äôs one of the most important parts of learning the material and allows you to actively engage with the lectures instead of passively watching :)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lon Capa Assignments:</strong> Luckily, these are already online! There will be no change to our regularly scheduled HW Assignments, Bonus Pre-Lecture Videos, and Bonus Surveys. Our course <a href="https://karleflanagan.github.io/stat100S20/pages/calendar.html" target="\_blank">calendar</a> is completely trustworthy and correct üòä</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Exams:</strong>  Exams will be done on <a href="https://lon-capa.uiuc.edu" target="\_blank">Lon Capa</a>, since you will already be familiar with that interface from the homework. Since we can‚Äôt proctor the exams in person, we have decided that they will be open book for everyone, but it is on your honor that they are not ‚Äúopen person‚Äù‚Äîyour answers should still be your answers and you should not work with anyone on the exams. These exams will be timed (90 minutes for exam 3 and 3 hours for the final).  You can take exam 3 anytime on April 15th and you can take the final any time on your assigned date (exam dates are posted on our website <a href="https://karleflanagan.github.io/stat100S20/pages/exam_schedule.html" target="\_blank">here</a>).  We will also offer conflict times to students who sign up, and we will offer extended time exams specifically for students with DRES letters including that accommodation. We will send more information on this as the time gets closer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Office Hours:</strong> We will hold Zoom Office Hours regularly throughout each week. They are Monday - Friday from 2-4pm Central Standard Time (CST).  We also added a time slot on Mondays from 7-9pm CST for students who can‚Äôt make the regular times or are in other time zones.   The link to office hours is on <a href="https://compass2g.illinois.edu/" target="\_blank"><u>Compass 2g</u></a>.  Zoom has a chat feature, share screen option, raise hand option, and many other helpful features. We can even split our Zoom session into multiple ‚Äúbreak out rooms‚Äù if we have a lot of students joining with questions. Watch this  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMY_HDVLijc" target="\_blank">~3 minute video from Kelly and Karle</a> to explain how office hours will work. Hope to see you there :)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your patience as we figure things out! Fortunately, we think Stat 100 should have a fairly straightforward transition, and while we will deeply miss seeing you all every week, we are hopeful that we can continue to interact with many of you on Zoom and offer you the best instruction and assistance we can üòä Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns- we‚Äôre always happy to help!  Thanks again!</p>

<p>-Karle Flanagan, Kelly Findley, and The Stat 100 Team</p>
